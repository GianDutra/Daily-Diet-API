## About the project

This project serves as an API for users to create and manage meals, as well as register new users. It was created to potentially integrate with a mobile application called Daily-Diet in the backend. Daily-Diet is a project from the native track, which currently focuses solely on the front-end. The API allows users to record meal details, including name, description, date, time, and whether the meal adheres to a specific diet. Additionally, users can edit, delete meals, and view metrics related to their food intake.

### Functional Requirements

- [X] Should be able to create a user
- [X] Should be able to identify the user between requests
- [X] Should be able to register a meal, with the following information:
    - [X] Meals must be related to a user.
    - [X] Name
    - [X] Description
    - [X] Date and Time
    - [X] Is it within the diet or not
- [X] Should be able to edit a meal, being able to change all the above data
- [X] Should be able to delete a meal
- [X] Should be able to list all meals from a user
- [X] Should be able to view a single meal
- [X] Should be able to retrieve metrics for a user
    - [X] Total number of registered meals
    - [X] Total number of meals within the diet
    - [X] Total number of meals outside the diet
    - [X] Best sequence of meals within the diet
- [X] The user can only view, edit and delete meals they created

## üöÄ Testing MyMealsAPI

 
```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/MyMealsAPI.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd MyMealsAPI

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in developer mode
$ npm run dev

# Access the API
To test the routes and interact with the API, you can use a tool like Insomnia or Postman. Follow these steps:

1. Open Insomnia or Postman on your computer.

2. Create a new request for each API route you want to test (e.g., POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).

3. Set the request URL to http://localhost:3333, which is the default address where your API should be running.

4. Configure the request method and add any required headers or request body parameters according to the route you want to test.
```
